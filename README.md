Hello!
This is a part of my snake game project using C, it is a terminal based project. 
In this project I have done the following: 

  -  Created the game board / background
  -  Let user control the movement with wasd.
  -  Not let Users turn around instanstly i.e if going up must turn left then down to go down.
  -  Change speed of the game from 1-5 speeds. 5 is the highest speed.
  -  If user goes to the border, they will appear on the other end.
  -  Finally, they can quit the game.  

The next part of the project will focus on the spawing of the apple in the game.
